				<h1>Harry Potter</h1>
				<p>
					I am Harry Potter. I studied 6 years at Hogwarts. It's a magic school.
					So that means I can do a lot of stuff. But you will learn about it
					later on in my cv.

				<p>
					I learned to know more about myself at hogwarts. I have lived 12 years
					under the stairs at my uncle's because my parents died when I was 1.
					But my family lied about the cause of their death so I didn't learn
					about magic before some man came barging in our vacation house. That's
					when I learned I had a enemy, he killed my parents. It was not easy to
					learn all of this but I grew bigger.
