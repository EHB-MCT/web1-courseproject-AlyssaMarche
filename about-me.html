				I’m Harry Potter, and my journey began at Hogwarts, where I spent six
				unforgettable years. Sorted into Gryffindor, I dove into the world of
				magic, learning spells, brewing potions, and flying on broomsticks. I
				even joined the Quidditch team as a Seeker, where my job was to catch
				the elusive Golden Snitch. And, more often than not, I led my team to
				victory. But my life wasn’t just about school. I didn’t even finish my
				seventh year—because I was too busy hunting Horcruxes. These dark,
				magical objects were tied to the soul of my greatest enemy, Voldemort.
				He had killed my parents in an attempt to destroy me, but I survived.
				Ever since, he’s tried to end me, driven by the belief that I was the
				one who would bring about his downfall. His followers, the Death Eaters,
				made my life miserable. <br />But I kept fighting. By my sixth year, I
				was already facing death head-on. Yet, the battle wasn’t over. It was my
				final confrontation with him that led to the end of his reign of terror.
				After everything, I even ended up working for the Ministry of
				Magic—despite their disbelief when I tried to warn them about
				Voldemort’s return during my fifth year. It’s funny how people who once
				doubted me would later rely on me. But I proved myself. Not just as the
				"Boy Who Lived," but as someone who helped shape the future of the
				wizarding world.
