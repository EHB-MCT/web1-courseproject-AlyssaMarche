				<h1>Who am I?</h1>
				<p>
					I'm Harry Potter. I studied at Hogwarts for 6 years. I was in
					Gryffindor. I learned magic there and others as well subjects such as
					making potions and flying. To my years at Hogwarts I also played with
					the quidditch team. I was a seeker. I had to find the golden snitch,
					it was a small golden ball that flew everywhere. My team almost always
					won. I didn't take my seventh year because I was looking for horcruxes
					that would kill my enemy. My lifelong enemy killed my parents. They
					tried to save my life, but they ended up dying. He was jealous,
					because some prediction he saw said I was going to be the end of his
					empire. He had what they called themselves the death-eaters who where
					against me. I defeated them in my supposed to be last year of school.
					And that's when life got a bit better. Finally I joined the ministry
					of magic even though they wanted me dead a few years ago during my
					fifth year, because they thought I lied about Voldemort being alive
					again. When I worked for them I was quite important.
